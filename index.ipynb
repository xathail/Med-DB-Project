    "- In a large family home or a small nursing home, managing the administration of medicines can be a complex task. With multiple individuals, each possibly requiring different medicines at different intervals, it becomes crucial to have a system in place that ensures safe and timely administration of doses. This is particularly important considering that each medicine has a required minimal interval between doses, a maximum dose per day, and age appropriateness.\n",
    "    - To address this challenge, we propose the creation of a medical logging database. This database will serve as a central repository of information about the individuals in the household or nursing home, the medicines they are taking, and a log of administered doses.\n",
    "    - The goal of this system is to provide a clear, user-friendly, and reliable way for adults in the household or nursing home staff to know when it is safe to administer the next dose of a particular medicine to a particular individual. This will help prevent overdoses or missed doses, ensuring the health and safety of all individuals involved. \n",

    "### **<u>What Needs Researching</u>** <a name=\"what-needs-researching-an\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographics:** Numbers in households / nursing homes that require regular medicine. This helps gauge the scale of the problem as well as tailor it to the average.\n",
    "- **Medicine Usage:** Most commonly used medicines, frequency of use, and dangers of overuse. This guides us into creating a database that can accommodate all information in a scalable way.\n",
    "- **Reminder Systems:** What are the most effective ways to remind and display information? How can this be intuitive and easy to use?\n",
    "- **Data Storage:** What are the best practices for storing information? How much should we factor efficiency in over security and privacy?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<u>Current Solutions</u>** <a name=\"current-solutions-an\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Notebooks and Paper Records:** Traditionally, people have used notebooks or paper records to keep track of medicine schedules. This method is simple and doesn't require any technical knowledge. However, it can be prone to human error and can be difficult to manage if there are multiple medicines or people involved.\n",
    "2. **Memory:** Some people rely on their memory to remember when to take their medicine. This can work for individuals with a single medicine schedule, but it becomes increasingly difficult with more medicines or complex schedules. It's also unreliable due to the possibility of forgetting, especially for elderly individuals or those with memory-related health issues.\n",
    "3. **Mobile Apps:** There are several mobile apps available that help manage medicine schedules. These apps can send reminders, keep track of medicine intake, and sometimes even provide information about the medicines. However, the quality and features of these apps can vary greatly.\n",
    "4. **Healthcare Providers:** Healthcare providers often give advice on how to manage medicine schedules. In some cases, they may provide tools or services to help manage this. However, this is often limited to their patients and may not be available to everyone.\n",
    "5. **Pharmacy Services:** Some pharmacies offer medicine management services. They can pre-package medicines according to the schedule, which can make it easier to manage. However, this service is usually only available for medicines purchased from that pharmacy.\n",
    "6. **Specialised Organisations:** There are organisations that specialise in medicine management, particularly for elderly individuals or those with complex medicine schedules. These organisations can provide comprehensive services, but they can be expensive and may not be available in all areas.\n",

    "### **<u>Questions to Consider</u>** <a name=\"questions-to-consider-an\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What operating systems do you use most frequently for managing tasks? (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, etc.)\n",
    "2. Would you prefer a graphical or text-based interface for a medicine management system?\n",
    "3. What types of reminders would you find most effective for taking your medicine? (Notifications, alarms, in-app only, etc.)\n",
    "4. What specific information about your medicine would you want to store in a management system?\n",
    "5. How would you prefer to label or annotate your medicine in a management system?\n",
    "6. Rank the following features in order of importance for a virtual medicine tool: Reminders, Information Storage, User-Friendly Interface, Security.\n",
    "7. Would you want to share your medicine information with others? If so, who would you want to share it with and what specific information would you want to share?\n",
    "8. What method would you prefer to use to share your medicine information? (Email, In-app sharing, etc.)\n",
    "9. How important is it for you to have access to detailed information about each medicine (e.g., side effects, interactions with other drugs)?\n",
    "10. How important is it for you to have a feature that allows you to export information in a user-friendly way?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<u>Objectives</u>** <a name=\"objectives-an\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design and implement a database with at least three tables:\n",
    "    - A \"People\" table to store information about the individuals in the household, including their ages.\n",
    "    - A \"Medicines\" table to store information about the different medicines, their required minimal interval between doses, maximum dose per day, and age appropriateness.\n",
    "    - A \"Log\" table to keep track of which medicines have been administered, to whom, and when.\n",
    "2. Develop a system that can use the information in these tables to determine when it is safe to administer the next dose of a particular medicine to a particular individual.\n",
    "3. Ensure the system is user-friendly and accessible to the adults in the household or nursing home staff, so they can easily log medicine administration and check when the next dose can be safely given.\n",
    "4. Implement a reminder system to alert the responsible adult when it's time to administer the next dose.\n",
    "5. Ensure the system is secure and respects the privacy of the individuals, only authorised users should have access to the medical data.\n",
    "6. The system should be robust and reliable, ensuring accurate tracking of medicine administration to prevent overdoses or missed doses."
