    "# **<u>Analysis</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<u>Overview</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a large family home or a small nursing home, managing the administration of medicines can be a complex task. With multiple individuals, each possibly requiring different medicines at different intervals, it becomes crucial to have a system in place that ensures safe and timely administration of doses. This is particularly important considering that each medicine has a required minimal interval between doses, a maximum dose per day, and age appropriateness.\n",
    "    - To address this challenge, we propose the creation of a medical logging database. This database will serve as a central repository of information about the individuals in the household or nursing home, the medicines they are taking, and a log of administered doses.\n",
    "    - The goal of this system is to provide a clear, user-friendly, and reliable way for adults in the household or nursing home staff to know when it is safe to administer the next dose of a particular medicine to a particular individual. This will help prevent overdoses or missed doses, ensuring the health and safety of all individuals involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **<u>What Needs Researching</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographics:** Numbers in households / nursing homes that require regular medicine. This helps gauge the scale of the problem as well as tailor it to the average.\n",
    "- **Medicine Usage:** Most commonly used medicines, frequency of use, and dangers of overuse. This guides us into creating a database that can accommodate all information in a scalable way.\n",
    "- **Reminder Systems:** What are the most effective ways to remind and display information? How can this be intuitive and easy to use?\n",
    "- **Data Storage:** What are the best practices for storing information? How much should we factor efficiency in over security and privacy?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<u>Current Solutions</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Notebooks and Paper Records:** Traditionally, people have used notebooks or paper records to keep track of medicine schedules. This method is simple and doesn't require any technical knowledge. However, it can be prone to human error and can be difficult to manage if there are multiple medicines or people involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sources/analysis/imgs/pen_paper.png\" alt=\"pen-paper\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory:** Some people rely on their memory to remember when to take their medicine. This can work for individuals with a single medicine schedule, but it becomes increasingly difficult with more medicines or complex schedules. It's also unreliable due to the possibility of forgetting, especially for elderly individuals or those with memory-related health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sources/analysis/imgs/thinking.png\" alt=\"thinking\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applications:** There are several mobile & desktop apps available that help manage medicine schedules. These apps can send reminders, keep track of medicine intake, and sometimes even provide information about the medicines. However, the quality and features of these apps can vary greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sources/analysis/imgs/applications.png\" alt=\"applications\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Healthcare Providers:** Healthcare providers often give advice on how to manage medicine schedules. In some cases, they may provide tools or services to help manage this. However, this is often limited to their patients and may not be available to everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sources/analysis/imgs/healthcare.png\" alt=\"healthcare\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pharmacy Services:** Some pharmacies offer medicine management services. They can pre-package medicines according to the schedule, which can make it easier to manage. However, this service is usually only available for medicines purchased from that pharmacy.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **<u>Questions to Consider</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What operating systems do you use most frequently for managing tasks? (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, etc.)**\n",
    "    - Our third party primarily uses iOS and Windows for managing tasks.\n",
    "    - As the third party primarily uses iOS and Windows, the medicine management system should be developed as a cross-platform application. This requires some technology that allows for development of applications that can run on multiple operating systems such as ElectronJS or React.\n",
    "2. **Would you prefer a graphical or text-based interface for a medicine management system?**\n",
    "    - Our third party would prefer a graphical interface as it allows for more fluid data entry, the ability to visualise countdowns, and other such features for ease of access.\n",
    "    -  Given the preference for a graphical interface, the system should be designed with a user-friendly and intuitive GUI. This could include visual elements like calendars for tracking dosage timings, charts for visualising medicine interactions, and easy-to-use forms for data entry.\n",
    "3. **What types of reminders would you find most effective for taking your medicine? (Notifications, alarms, in-app only, etc.)**\n",
    "    - Our third party finds notifications and alarms to be the most effective. They also highlighted the need for reminders about the minimum time to wait between doses.\n",
    "    - The system should implement a robust notification system that can send reminders on both iOS and Windows. This could involve push notifications for mobile devices and desktop notifications for Windows. Additionally, the system should be able to calculate the minimum time to wait between doses and set reminders accordingly.\n",
    "4. **What specific information about your medicine would you want to store in a management system?**\n",
    "    - Our third party would like the system to store information about dosage timings and interactions between different medicines.\n",
    "    - The system should have a well-structured database to store information about dosage timings and medicine interactions. This could involve tables for medicines, users, and dosage logs, with appropriate relations to track interactions and timings.\n",
    "5. **Rank the following features in order of importance for a virtual medicine tool: Reminders, Information Storage, User-Friendly Interface, Security.**\n",
    "    - Our third party ranked the features in the following order of importance: User-Friendly Interface, Information Storage, Reminders, Security.\n",
    "    - Given the ranking of features, the system should prioritise developing a user-friendly interface, followed by robust information storage, effective reminders, and finally, security measures. Each feature should be developed with the user's needs in mind to ensure the system is as useful and usable as possible.\n",
    "6. **Would you want to share your medicine information with others? If so, what specific information would you want to share and how?**\n",
    "    - Our third party mentioned that it might be useful to export medicine timings to share with a doctor via an output file.\n",
    "    - The system should include a feature to export medicine timings. This could be implemented as a downloadable file in a universally readable format like CSV or PDF, which can be easily shared with a doctor.\n",
    "7. **How important is it for you to have access to detailed information about each medicine (e.g., side effects, interactions with other drugs)?**\n",
    "    - Our third party suggests that though detailed information about each medicine could be useful, the most important feature is the management of medicine timings and interactions.\n",
    "    - While detailed information about each medicine could be useful, the primary focus should be on managing medicine timings and interactions. This could involve a feature to add and track medicines and their timings, and a system to warn users about potential interactions when a new medicine is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<u>Objectives</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Design and implement a database with at least three tables:**\n",
    "    - **People:** This table will store information about the individuals in the household or nursing home. The data stored will include their names and ages.\n",
    "    - **Medicines:** This table will store information about the different medicines. The data stored will include the name of the medicine, the required minimal interval between doses, the maximum dose per day, and the age appropriateness.\n",
    "    - **Log:** This table will keep track of which medicines have been administered, to whom, and when. The data stored will include the name of the individual, the name of the medicine, and the time and date of administration.\n",
    "    - **Implementation:** The database can be implemented using SQL, such as SQLite or PostgreSQL. The tables can be created using SQL statements, and the data can be queried and manipulated using SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Develop a system that can use the information in these tables to determine when it is safe to administer the next dose of a particular medicine to a particular individual.**\n",
    "    - **Language and Framework:** The system can be developed using a programming language like Python, and a web framework like Django or Flask. These frameworks provide tools for handling database operations and building web applications.\n",
    "    - **Mapping the Database:** The database tables can be mapped to Python classes using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool like SQLAlchemy. This allows for easy interaction with the database using Python code.\n",
    "    - **Calculating Safe Dose Time:** The system can calculate the time since the last dose was administered by comparing the current time with the time of the last administration recorded in the Log table. It can then compare this time difference with the minimal interval between doses to determine if it is safe to administer the next dose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensure the system is user-friendly and accessible to the adults in the household or nursing home staff.**\n",
    "    - **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The system can have a user-friendly GUI built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allows for easy navigation and interaction with the system.\n",
    "    - **Responsive Design:** The GUI can be designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices, making it accessible to users on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.\n",
    "    - **Intuitive Interface:** The GUI can have intuitive forms and controls for logging medicine administration and checking when the next dose can be safely given. This can include features like calendars for selecting dates and times, dropdown menus for selecting individuals and medicines, and clear instructions for data entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement a reminder system to alert the responsible adult when it's time to administer the next dose.**\n",
    "    - **Notification Services:** The system can integrate with notification services like Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS devices and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android devices. This allows the system to send push notifications to the responsible adult's device when it's time to administer the next dose.\n",
    "    - **Scheduled Tasks:** The system can use scheduled tasks or cron jobs to periodically check the database for upcoming doses and send notifications accordingly. This ensures that reminders are sent at the appropriate times.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ensure the system is secure and respects the privacy of the individuals.**\n",
    "    - **Authentication and Authorisation:** The system can implement user authentication and authorisation mechanisms to ensure that only authorised users have access to the medical data. This can be achieved using frameworks like Django's built-in authentication system or implementing OAuth for third-party authentication.\n",
    "    - **Data Encryption:** The system can encrypt sensitive data like personal information and medical records to protect them from unauthorised access. This can be done using encryption algorithms and secure storage mechanisms.\n",
    "    - **Secure Communication:** The system can use secure communication protocols like HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring that sensitive information is protected during transit.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **The system should be robust and reliable.**\n",
    "    - **Error Handling:** The system can implement proper error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors gracefully. This includes validating user input, handling database errors, and providing informative error messages to users.\n",
    "    - **Testing and Quality Assurance:** The system can be thoroughly tested using automated testing frameworks like pytest or unittest. This ensures that the system functions as expected and helps identify and fix any bugs or issues.\n",
    "    - **Scalability and Performance:** The system can be designed to handle a large number of users and a large amount of data without slowing down or crashing. This can be achieved by optimising database queries, using caching mechanisms, and employing scalable infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<u>Limitations</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Accuracy:**\n",
    "    - **Individual Information:** Accurate input of individual's information is crucial for the system to function correctly. Any inaccuracies could lead to incorrect reminders.\n",
    "    - **Medicine Information:** The system relies on accurate data about medicines and their dosages. Incorrect information could lead to unsafe administration of medicines.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Compliance:**\n",
    "    - **Logging Doses:** The system's effectiveness is dependent on users consistently logging administered doses. If a dose is administered but not logged, it could lead to unsafe administration of subsequent doses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Technical Knowledge:**\n",
    "    - **User-Friendliness:** The system is designed to be user-friendly, but some level of technical knowledge is required. This could be a barrier for some users, particularly in a household setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access to Technology:**\n",
    "    - **Internet Connectivity:** The system requires a device with internet connectivity. Limited or unreliable access could be a limitation in certain settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Privacy and Security:**\n",
    "    - **Data Storage:** Storing sensitive medical information raises concerns about privacy and data security. Despite implementing security measures, there is always a risk of data breaches or unauthorised access.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Medicine Complexity:**\n",
    "    - **Medicine Interactions:** The system is designed to handle common scenarios of medicine administration, but may not accommodate complexities like interactions between different medicines.\n",
    "    - **Regimen Changes:** Changes in a person's medicine regimen may not be adequately handled by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Emergency Situations:**\n",
    "    - **Overriding Schedules:** The system is not designed to handle emergency situations where normal medicine administration schedules may need to be overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Regulatory Compliance:**\n",
    "    - **Legal Requirements:** Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be legal and regulatory requirements related to the storage and handling of medical information that the system must comply with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# **<u>Documented Design</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example UI Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals of our User Interface (UI) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Usability**: The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate. Even first-time users should be able to understand how to interact with the application without extensive instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: The UI should be designed in a way that allows users to perform tasks quickly and efficiently. This includes minimising the number of clicks or actions required to perform a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency**: The UI should maintain consistency across different sections of the application. This includes consistent use of colors, fonts, and layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Responsiveness**: The UI should be responsive, meaning it should look and function well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some potential pages of a design that fulfills these features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Navigation**\n",
    "\n",
    "With a navbar that's just a hamburger away, it allows for quick navigation for all users, helping them find exactly what is needed in a much more categorised way.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sources/design/imgs/navbar.png\" alt=\"navbar\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Logs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping logs is vital, especially if managing a nursing home. With these, it'll be much easier to find any unauthorised access attempts, as well as create a rollback point in the unlikely event of database issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sources/design/imgs/logs.png\" alt=\"logs\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### **User Settings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a dedicated user settings page will allow for quick changes to a system, something particularly useful for if sharing access with others on a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sources/design/imgs/user_settings.png\" alt=\"user-settings\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchy Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "**To create a hierarchy chart visualisation for the design, I wrote up some code that would take in an input file of an easily understandable config, convert that to something that is easier to work with code-wise, and then create a graphic visualisation of this.**\n",
